## Status

This project is not maintained any longer. We still like the Idea, but have no use case for this anymore. Feel free to fork and learn from it if you like.

## TODO

* validate input from user on python side
* research if validation can be used to extract the values the user should be able to see from the full current data json blob
* research if there is any help in merging the json after validating the input - probably need to write a deep merge
